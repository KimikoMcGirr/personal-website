I recently (06/19/2020) graduated with my PhD in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology from UNC Chapel Hill.

I started this website on 06/24/2020 mostly to document how my job search goes during COVID-19. So it's a work in progress!

Rather than regurgitate my [resume](../files/Resume.pdf) or CV, I thought I'd use this space to give me more depth.

### Who am I?

I am a systems biologist who loves to think about how to model dynamical systems.
But really, I'm a "jack of all trades, master of _some_."

My real skill set is that I'm super adaptable. I work really hard to fill in the gaps on my team.
- Need a beta-version graphic design? [I got you.](https://honorable-diligent-serval.anvil.app/)
- Need an event organizer? I was:
  - Director of Operations for Johns Hopkins Model United Nations (2015)
  - Director of NIH-UNC Codeathons (2017-2020)
  - The planner of 2 weddings (COVID-19 canceled my first one)... Okay, my [cool husband](https://joemcgirr.github.io/)
  and my mom helped.
- Need a website?
  - Well, you're here now.
  - But also, here's [my wedding website](kimikoandjoemcgirr.com) I built from an html5 template!

I went to graduate school not knowing how to code. I didn't know what an ODE system was, let alone how to solve one.
But over the course of 5 years, I've now mastered these areas enough to [show it off to the public](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.20.051599v1).

Bottom line is, I love learning new skills and getting stuff done.
But the thing that gets me up in the morning is knowing that people want me to help them.

### What do I want to do?

I want to make a team thrive. I love being tasked with multiple jobs that require very different skillsets.
That being said, my skillset is in strategizing in the space between data and modeling.
I try to build the best models for the question I want to answer and squeeze as much information
out of it as possible. I also operate under the idea that models should be used for more than
just validating a hypothesis or classifying a new datapoint. I like to design my models with the intention that I will
be using them to
